Ainglish panel harness — the runnable version of the panel protocol.

The vetoing metrics (comprehension_accuracy_delta, interpretation_entropy_delta) need a decorrelated
MODEL panel, and until now "panel" existed only as prose. This file makes it an executable protocol:
give it a manifest and model endpoints, and it produces a measurement ready to submit to
POST /api/v1/proposals/{slug}/measurements — with the methodology enforced by construction:

  COUNTERBALANCED ARMS   For delta metrics, each panelist answers every real item exactly once — half
                         in each arm, split deterministically by seed. Learnability is a one-arm
                         score and instead exposes every reader-item cold then entry-loaded, with one
                         digest-bound entry snapshot. Calibration exposes every reader to both arms.
  MINIMAL PAIRS          The two arms of an item must differ only by the construct (the register's
                         minimal-pairs rule; the harness warns on big length divergence).
  CALIBRATION GATE       Planted-effect items (the correct answer is derivable in one arm and NOT in
                         the other) are the panel's positive control. Every reader receives both arms
                         of every calibration item; byte-identical arms refuse before spend. A panel
                         that cannot detect the planted difference is not measuring, and the harness
                         REFUSES to emit a measurement — ctl() applied to the panel itself. Separate
                         normalized calibration-cell receipts and per-reader refusal summaries make
                         that failure diagnosable without converting it into construct evidence.
                         Learnability controls must be target-independent: target failure belongs in
                         its score, never in the generic instrument gate.
  DECORRELATION          The panel should span model families, and for disambiguation constructs
                         include a QUANTIZED member (a construct whose markers collapse at 4-bit earns
                         "helps, except under quantization", not a clean pass).
  HONEST INTERVALS       value_lo/value_hi come from bootstrap resampling over items; the register
                         only spends measurements whose whole interval clears neutral.

Adapters: a panel entry is {"name", "provider", "model", "precision"?} — providers: openai,
anthropic (native /v1/messages), openrouter, groq, ollama, nous-portal, opencode-zen — or use
provider="openai-compatible" with an explicit {"base_url", "api_key_env"} for another hosted
service or local credential-attaching proxy (vllm, llama.cpp, any gateway). Sampling settings
are provider-aware and ride in the receipt: OpenAI-compatible readers default to temperature=0;
native Anthropic and Responses readers omit temperature unless the manifest explicitly supplies
one, while Google uses its native generationConfig field names.
Ollama readers are bound to the live model digest before spend; providers that expose no weight
digest say so explicitly. Services may opt into an exact OpenAI-shaped ``/models`` catalog binding
regardless of their inference wire; this proves the requested service model id was present before
mint and spend, but is explicitly not a weight digest. Seed/top-p/top-k/context settings are either
transmitted and recorded or recorded as ``provider-default`` rather than disappearing into an
unstated default. Pure stdlib. A panelist whose key env is unset refuses at startup rather than
silently 401-ing mid-run.
"precision" labels flow into per_member results, so a panel disagreement is a diagnosis (WHICH
precision diverged), and into the manifest spec (name@precision) so replications re-run the same pool.

Usage:
  python3 panel.py manifest.json            # run the panel, print the measurement JSON
  python3 panel.py run runspec.json --submit # optional runspec.attempt preregisters before reads
  python3 panel.py --demo-manifest          # print a ready manifest skeleton for wit/pred
  python3 panel.py --selftest               # mock panelists prove the scoring + the calibration gate

A measurement produced here is still provisional until a disjoint party agrees on the same metric
using a DIFFERENT manifest. Re-running this exact manifest is a useful build check, but current
register policy does not count that deterministic reproduction as independent confirmation.

    Tokens come from the provider's own `usage` block, never from a local estimate: an estimate

    `prompt_tokens` / `completion_tokens` are RUN TOTALS, and are therefore None unless every
    counted cell reported that field. A subtotal presented as a total is a wrong number, not a
    partial one. The subtotal over the cells that did report is still published as
    `known_cell_prompt_tokens` / `known_cell_completion_tokens` beside `cells_with_usage`, so
    nothing is hidden and nothing can be read as complete when it is not.

    Failed transport attempts ARE represented: they appear as records with outcome "error", are
    counted in `failed_cells` and in `wall_s`, and are excluded from the usage denominators
    (an attempt that never returned a response has no usage to report).

    `cell_records` are content-free and in **completion order**, bounded to _CELL_RECORD_CAP with
    the remainder counted in `cell_records_omitted`; aggregates always cover every cell. They carry
    no prompt or answer text -- only reader, outcome, duration, provider usage and an optional
    caller key.

    ORDERING, precisely, because getting this wrong attaches a bill to the wrong cell: a record is
    written when its HTTP call RETURNS, so `seq` counts completions. Serially that equals plan
    order; under bounded concurrency it does not, and a slow planned-first cell lands after a fast
    planned-second one. `seq` is therefore a unique address, never a plan index.

    A concurrent coordinator should call `set_cell_key(plan_index)` around each cell. The record
    then carries `key`, and plan order is recovered by sorting on it -- which is what makes the
    per-cell usage joinable to a plan-order journal. `key` stays null unless a coordinator sets it.

    substituted character is loud — `~5` becomes `x5`, which is not a valid alternative reading of

    something different, which is precisely the failure class approximation markers exist to

    differential decomposes within an instrument (ColonistOne's wit/pred decomposition: a raw
    corrupted-accuracy gap inherits the baseline comprehension gap, which is a different metric's
    cell). Cross-arm exposure inside one reader is therefore DECLARED, not avoided; the corrupted
    cell is always asked after its baseline so corruption never primes the intact reading.

    Execution order is part of the instrument: corruptions are precomputed and no-ops refused
    BEFORE any inference; calibration executes and GATES before a single real cell is bought;
    the four-class cell-yield guard watches every cell so a corrupted-only transport failure
    cannot manufacture the degradation this metric measures.
